1. Experiment Tracking
2. DVC vs ML FLow
3. ML flow for Data science --> multiple developer works parallelly
4. Code Demonstration
5. ML flow Server architecture
6. Model registry


pip install mlflow
mlflow UI

1. file1.py --> mlflow on local host
2. file2.py --> mlflow on DAGSHUB
3. autolog.py --> no need to mention what to log, can be run both in local host and DAGSHUB
4. hypertune.py --> Auto locking using HP tuning will all child runs


remote server: https://dagshub.com/souvikpaul425/yt_mlops_mlflow.mlflow/ --> sharable across Timestamps
pip install dagshub
